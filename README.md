# Tutorial: How to solve a Machine Learning Regression problem

The script **"ml_problem_resolution.py"** is a mini-tutorial presenting an approach to solving regression problems in machine learning by detailing at each step the different operations that have been performed in order to optimise the final result.

Technically, the work will focus on the dataset **"dataset.csv"** with 34 features and a target to predict.

To execute this file, simply run the command 
-> pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 ml_problem_resolution.py
in a terminal (preferably Linux).

Any improvement or feedback is welcome.

Have a good read!
